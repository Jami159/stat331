# 7. y = count, x = temp

a)
```
> bike = read.csv(file = "bike_share.csv", header = TRUE)
> x = bike$temp
> y = bike$count
> plot(x, y, ylab = "Number of Bike Rentals in a Given Hourly Period", xlab = "Outdoor Temperature (in Farenheit)", main = "Number of Bike Rentals vs Outdoor Temperature")

```
> cor(x, y) 
[1] 0.3945
```

The correlation coefficient is 0.4, meaning that there is a weak positive linear relationship between `x` and `y`.
This means that the rise in temperature has a weak positive effect on the number of bike rentals in a given hourly period.

b)
```
> beta1_hat = cor(x,y) * sd(y) / sd(x)
[1] 5.0947
> beta0_hat = mean(y) - beta1_hat * mean(x)
[1] -156.9856
> mu_hat = beta0_hat + beta1_hat * x    # eq'n of line of best fit 
```

c)
`beta0_hat = -156.9856` is the y-intercept of the line of best fit.
However, this doesn't really make sense as you can't have a negative number of bike rentals at a temperature of 0 degrees (or at any temperature).
`beta1_hat = 5.0947` is the slope of the line of best of fit.
This means that for each degree increase in temperature, there's around 5 more bike rentals.

e)
```
> y0 = beta0_hat + beta1_hat * 70
[1] 199.6465
> se_y0 = sigma_hat_lse * sqrt(1 + (1/n) + ((70-mean(x))^2/sxx))
[1] 166.4719
> low_PL = y0 - crit_val * se_y0
[1] -126.6687
> upp_PL = y0 + crit_val * se_y0
[1] 525.9617
```

The number of bike rentals in hours for which the temperature is 70 degrees Farenheit is predicted to be 200 with a 95% prediction interval of (-126.6687, 525.9617).

f)
```
> model = lm(y ~ x)
> s = summary(model)

> se_beta1 = s$coefficients[2,2]
[1] 0.1138
> t = beta1_hat / se_beta1
[1] 44.7831
> p_val = 2*pt(q = abs(t), df = n - 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
[1] 0
```

The p-value associated with `H0: beta1` is `0`. So we reject the null hypothesis. This means that bike rentals do appear to be significantly influenced by the outside temperature.
