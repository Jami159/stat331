# 8. y = count, x = humidity

a)
```
> bike = read.csv(file = "bike_share.csv", header = TRUE)
> x = bike$humidity
> y = bike$count
> plot(x, y, ylab = "Number of Bike Rentals in a Given Hourly Period", xlab = "Relative Humidity (%)", main = "Number of Bike Rentals vs Relative Humidity")

```
> cor(x, y) 
[1] -0.3174
```

The correlation coefficient is -0.32, meaning that there is a weak negative linear relationship between `x` and `y`.
This means that the increase in humidity has a weak negative effect on the number of bike rentals in a given hourly period.

b)
```
> beta1_hat = cor(x,y) * sd(y) / sd(x)
[1] -2.9873
> beta0_hat = mean(y) - beta1_hat * mean(x)
[1] 376.4456
> mu_hat = beta0_hat + beta1_hat * x    # eq'n of line of best fit 
```

c)
`beta0_hat = 376.4456` is the y-intercept of the line of best fit.
`beta1_hat = -2.9873` is the slope of the line of best of fit.

d)

e)
```
> y0 = beta0_hat + beta1_hat * 40
[1] 256.9549
> se_y0 = sigma_hat_lse * sqrt(1 + (1/n) + ((40-mean(x))^2/sxx))
[1] 171.8055
> low_PL = y0 - crit_val * se_y0
[1] -79.8152
> upp_PL = y0 + crit_val * se_y0
[1] 593.7249
```

The number of bike rentals in hours for which the temperature is 70 degrees Farenheit is predicted to be 200 with a 95% prediction interval of (-126.6687, 525.9617).

f)
```
> model = lm(y ~ x)
> s = summary(model)

> se_beta1 = s$coefficients[2,2]
[1] 0.0856
> t = beta1_hat / se_beta1
[1] -34.9153
> p_val = 2*pt(q = abs(t), df = n - 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
[1] 2.9215e-253
```

The p-value associated with `H0: beta1` is `0`. So we reject the null hypothesis. This means that bike rentals do appear to be significantly influenced by the outside temperature.
