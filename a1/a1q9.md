# 9. y = count, x = windspeed

a)
```
> bike = read.csv(file = "bike_share.csv", header = TRUE)
> x = bike$windspeed
> y = bike$count
> plot(x, y, ylab = "Number of Bike Rentals in a Given Hourly Period", xlab = "Wind Speed (miles/hr)", main = "Number of Bike Rentals vs Wind Speed")

```
> cor(x, y) 
[1] 0.1014
```

The correlation coefficient is 0.1, meaning that there is a very weak positive linear relationship between `x` and `y`.
This means that the increase in wind speed has a very weak positive effect on the number of bike rentals in a given hourly period.

b)
```
> beta1_hat = cor(x,y) * sd(y) / sd(x)
[1] 2.2491
> beta0_hat = mean(y) - beta1_hat * mean(x)
[1] 162.7876
> mu_hat = beta0_hat + beta1_hat * x    # eq'n of line of best fit 
```

c)
`beta0_hat = 162.7876` is the y-intercept of the line of best fit.
This means that if there is no wind, we can expect this to be the number of biker rentals.
`beta1_hat = 2.2491` is the slope of the line of best of fit.
This means that for each mile/hr increase in wind speed, there's around 2.2 more bike rentals.

e)
```
> y0 = beta0_hat + beta1_hat * 10
[1] 185.2781
> se_y0 = sigma_hat_lse * sqrt(1 + (1/n) + ((10-mean(x))^2/sxx))
[1] 180.2289
> low_PL = y0 - crit_val * se_y0
[1] -168.0033
> upp_PL = y0 + crit_val * se_y0
[1] 538.5595
```

The number of bike rentals in hours for which the wind speed is 10 miles per hour is predicted to be 185 with a 95% prediction interval of (-168.0033, 538.5595).

f)
```
> model = lm(y ~ x)
> s = summary(model)

> se_beta1 = s$coefficients[2,2]
[1] 0.2116
> t = beta1_hat / se_beta1
[1] 10.6303
> p_val = 2*pt(q = abs(t), df = n - 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
[1] 2.8984e-26
```

The p-value associated with `H0: beta1` is `2.90e-26`. So we reject the null hypothesis. This means that bike rentals do appear to be significantly influenced by the wind speeds.
